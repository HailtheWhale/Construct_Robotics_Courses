# Construct_Robotics_Courses
The files that I've made upon completion of Construct Courses. Some commands are copy pasted if solutions were provided for that lesson, as is the case with beginner level parts of the courses. 

# File Organization
The files indicated are organized based on the course structure of the Construct website. 
Example: The Intro Courses: Intro to C++, Intro to Python, Intro to Linux, will all be subfolders under "Intro Courses."
