# Construct_Robotics_Courses
The files for exercises that I've made upon completion of Construct Courses. *Some commands were copy pasted if solutions were provided for that lesson, as is the case with beginner level parts of the courses.* **This was mostly done for quality of life print statements**, which the website has done for the sake of demonstration and to ensure the exercise was done right.  

The link to the website for these exercises is: [Construct Robotics](https://app.theconstructsim.com/).

NOTE: To do this yourself, you WILL need a subscription to the website. Demos of what the code is supposed to do is either provided with snapshots or videos. In the case of videos being too large for Github, a Youtube link is provided instead.

## File Organization
The files indicated are organized based on the course structure of the Construct website: [Construct Robotics](https://app.theconstructsim.com/). 

Example: The Intro Courses: Intro to C++, Intro to Python, Intro to Linux, will all be subfolders under "Intro Courses."

## File Use
Separate readme files have been added to each course for info on how to run the given program. Additional locational info of where the exercise was in the lessons is provided as part of the file.
