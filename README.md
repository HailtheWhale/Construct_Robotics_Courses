# Construct_Robotics_Courses
The highlight files for exercises that I've made upon completion of Construct Courses with demos. *Some commands for independent exercises were copy pasted.* **This was mostly done for quality of life print statements**, which the website has done for the sake of command prompt demonstration and to ensure the exercise was done right. *Some* exercises are supposed to be copy pasted. Those that are like this will be indicated in the readme for the lesson, and indicated at the top of the individual script.

The link to the website for these exercises is: [Construct Robotics](https://app.theconstructsim.com/).

NOTE: Demos of what the code is supposed to do is either provided with snapshots or videos. In the case of videos being too large for Github, a Youtube link is provided instead. If you'd like to do this yourself, you **WILL** need a subscription to the website. This is to ensure that under the hood Gazebos or background files are there and running. 

## File Organization
The files indicated are organized based on the course structure of the Construct website: [Construct Robotics](https://app.theconstructsim.com/). 

**Example**: The Intro Courses | Intro to C++, Intro to Python, Intro to Linux, will all be subfolders under "Intro Courses."

## File Use
Separate readme files have been added to each course for info on what was done to get the dmos. These are provided under the assumption that you are in the given lesson for the website. Additional locational info of where the exercise was in the lessons is provided as part of the file.
