# **Upon realizing that the size of this repo will become very large very quickly after completing several courses, it has been decided to move/ redo all completed courses thus far to other repositories. This will instead be a landing page containing links to the relevant repos and demos (WIP).**
# Construct/Ignite_Academy_Robotics_Coursework
The files for exercises that I've made upon completion of Construct Courses with noteworthy demos. Since this is very much a learning website, *Some commands or entire code files for independent exercises were copy pasted as part of the given exercise.* **Files that are like this have "THIS WAS PROVIDED BY THE CONSTRUCT" written at the top of the file.** Files that I've done entirely ***independently will not have this written at the top***. 

The link to the website for these exercises is: [Construct Robotics](https://app.theconstructsim.com/).

NOTE: Demos of what the code is supposed to do is either provided with snapshots or videos. Videos too big for GitHub are added as Youtube links. If you'd like to do this yourself, you **WILL** need a subscription to the website. This is to ensure that under the hood Gazebos or background files are there and running. Granted, you'd be able to do this assuming you had ROS and all the packages, but I won't cover that.

## File Organization
The files indicated are organized based on the course structure of the Construct website. The link to this site was provided previously. 

**Example**: The Intro Courses | Intro to C++, Intro to Python, Intro to Linux, are subfolders under "Intro Courses."

Various independent projects have been completed in the process of finishing certain courses to demonstrate working knowledge. The types of projects are as follows:
1. Micro-Projects
 - Small projects to demonstrate concepts of what was learned.
2. Lesson Tests
 - Robotically graded "quizzes." Specific instructions and code functional requirements are provided, and these must be **strictly followed** to ensure a high score. 
 3. Public Construct hosted GitHub projects
 - Repositories that students may push and share what they've accomplished. Links to these will be provided if they are involved. 
 4. Rosjects
 - What the Construct prides themselves on. A project involving working with a physical robot located in one of their facilities. These are like the Lesson Tests mentioned previously, but are composed of multiple stages.
 
 ### Project Presentations
 **Some** of the courses give the opportunity to present what was done in a particular course or Rosject to the Construct. Upon completion of this, a certificate is provided to demonstrate an acknowledged working proficiency in the subject. I will post the certificate along with the given Rosject and presentation upon completing  one of these.  

## Nested README's.
Highlights of what was learned for a course will be provided in that course's README file. In addition, the cool snapshots and videos for that course are posted here as well. 

# Thanks
To the Construct for giving me an opportunity to push my ROS learning to the next level. These courses have, are, and will continue to build my robotics foundation. Trying to perform the robotics research that I like doing would have been ***MUCH*** more difficult without these courses. Truly. Thank you.
