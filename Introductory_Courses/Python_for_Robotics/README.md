# Python for Robotics
The "Python for Robotics" course provided by the Construct. 

## Interesting info that was learned:
- Python is use in many Machine Learning applications, and is commonly used in ROS programs.
- Objects Oriented Programming is better for more complicated programs as opposed to Procedure Oriented. Namely ones which have many functions that must share variables. 
- Using the "global" keyword is only safe for small scripts. 
- Prints are extremely helpful for debugging. 
- When working with LaserScanners, it's best to incorporate the data from multiple parts of a scan into boolean logic rather than one scan. This makes the program more robust.

## Skills that were learned:
- Importing Python modules, making variables from classes, calling valiables and methods from class instances.
- Different variable types, and how to maniplate these. 
- How to work with user input.
- Constructing boolean logic. 
- Forming FOR and WHILE loops. 
- Making functions.
- Creating classes. 

## Snapshots and Demonstrations
Snapshots and demonstrations of what I found interesting. 

A while loop to continously check the distance of an object in front of the Turtlebot, and then stop when the robot is < 1 meter from the wall.

A script which calls methods from the robot_control_class object to make the Summit robot go into a room.

An instanciated object which makes the Summit robot go to an opening, and then move in a small and big square.

An instanciated object which makes the Turtlebot escape the Maze and celebrate.
