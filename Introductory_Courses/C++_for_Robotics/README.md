# C++ for Robotics
The "C++ for Robotics Course" offered by the Construct.

## Interesting Info that was learned:
- C++ is a compiled language... meaning every script change must be compiled before it may be executed.
- ROS can handle C++ compilation.
- C++ variables must have their types defined before use. 
- C++ functions must return the same value as whatever value the function is set as
- Pointers allow for tight memory resource control. They are what may make C++ special. 

## Skills that were learned:
- Importing modules. Creating variables (lists, dictionaries, arrays, etc.)
- Boolean logic. For and While loops.
- Creating functions.
- Creating pointers to variables. Modifying variables via pointers.
- Creating basic C++ classes.
