### Changing Permissions

- Notice the permissions on the far left.

![permissions3](https://github.com/HailtheWhale/Image_Repo/blob/main/Construct_Robotics_Courses/Introductory_Courses/Linux_for_Robotics/Permissions_EX3.png)
    
- Notice how execution permissions were removed fom everyone. 
    
![permissions4](https://github.com/HailtheWhale/Image_Repo/blob/main/Construct_Robotics_Courses/Introductory_Courses/Linux_for_Robotics/Permissions_EX4.png)

- Notice how now there are no permissions for the file at all.
    
 ### Bash Files
 ![bash1](https://github.com/HailtheWhale/Image_Repo/blob/main/Construct_Robotics_Courses/Introductory_Courses/Linux_for_Robotics/Bash_File_Ex.png)
    
 - Notice how bash files may be used to run multiple terminal commands in sequence. 
    
 #### Variable Bash Files 
 Notice how you can use variables to determine which commands to run based on user input.
